Assures that only one thread at a time will enter the closures passed for the given lock.

Consider that passing self might be bad since other classes can use your object as a lock, and lead
to deadlocks.

- parameter lock:    The lock to use as a semaphore
- parameter closure: The closure to run thread safely.
